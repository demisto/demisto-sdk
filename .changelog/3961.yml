changes:
- description: Log files will now be saved by default to `$HOME/.demisto-sdk/logs`. This behavior can be overridden by the `--log-file-path` flag, or the `DEMISTO_SDK_LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
  type: feature
- description: Log file path (can be set by the `--log-file-path` flag or the `DEMISTO_SDK_LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable) can now only accept directory values. Setting it to a file path is no longer supported (file name is now constantly `demisto_sdk_debug.log` and cannot be changed). The path will now be automatically generated if it doesn't exist.
