changes:
- description: Log files will now be saved by default to `$HOME/.demisto-sdk/logs`. This behavior can be overridden by the `--log-file-path` flag, or the `DEMISTO_SDK_LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
  type: feature
- description: Log file path (set by the `--log-file-path` flag or the `DEMISTO_SDK_LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable) can no longer be set to a file name in order to set log file's name, and will now generate the path if it didn't exist before.
