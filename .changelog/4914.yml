- description: |
    Make multiple enhancements and fixes to `XsoarClient` and `XsiamClient` classes:
      - Add a new `XsiamClient.search_alerts_by_name` method and fix an issue in the `XsiamClient.search_alerts_by_uuid` method that caused the logic to iterate over the first 100 results only.
      - Add a new `XsiamClient.poll_alert_state` method that polls a Cortex XSIAM alert until it reaches any of the expected states.
      - Rename `XsoarClient.pull_playbook_tasks_by_state` to `XsoarClient.poll_playbook_tasks_by_state` and fix a timeout-related issue in the method.
