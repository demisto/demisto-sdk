    This feature introduces an interactive process for formatting new playbooks. When a user
    runs the format command on a new playbook, the tool will now ask if they wish to create it as a silent playbook.

    - If the user answers **yes**:
      - The playbook's `name` and `id` are automatically prefixed with "silent-".
      - The `issilent: true` field is added to the playbook's YAML.
      - The `fromversion` is set to a minimum of **8.9.0**.

    - If the user answers **no**:
      - The `issilent: false` field is explicitly set in the YAML.
      - The `fromversion` is set to the default of **6.10.0**.
