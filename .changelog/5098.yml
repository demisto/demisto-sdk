    Enhanced GR110 validator for Agentix Actions:
    - Fixed error messages to show command names instead of integration/pack names
    - Fixed error messages to display both AgentixAction input name and underlying argument name for better debugging
    - Validator now runs bidirectionally: validates actions when changed, and also validates dependent actions when underlying integrations/scripts change
    - Refactored code for better maintainability: extracted helper methods, reduced duplication (~35% code reduction)
    - Improved validation to check both missing references AND UI name mismatches independently
  type: fix
