    Fixed file type detection to prioritize filename checks over directory path checks.
    This prevents the formatter from corrupting JSON files (like pack_metadata.json) when
    they exist in directories whose names contain content type keywords (e.g., "Lists", "Jobs").

    Previously, directory substring matching would misdetect files, causing the formatter
    to strip required fields. This fix ensures pack_metadata.json and other specific files
    are correctly identified regardless of their parent directory name.
