    Fixed id_set generation crash when processing lists with separate metadata
    and data files. Lists can store metadata (with 'id' field) and data in
    separate files. The fix skips data-only files that lack the 'id' field,
    preventing AttributeError during sorting while correctly including list
    metadata files in the id_set.
