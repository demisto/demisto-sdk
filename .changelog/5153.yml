    Add web console link to output of `demisto-sdk run-test-playbook` and `demisto-sdk run-playbook`.
    Previously, the output of these commands linked to the API endpoint of the associated WorkPlan. This is not
    helpful to debug visually, so this PR adds the possibility for the user to click to go directly to the
    Web Console and see the workplan visually, which is much more helpful when debugging.
