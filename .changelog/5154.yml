changes:
- description: |
    - Add a sleep before `self.get_test_playbook_results_dict()` in `demisto-sdk run-test-playbook`. This fixes a race condition where the method was called before the WorkPlan was actually created, resulting in a crash of the command.
    - Lower sleep time from 10 to 3 seconds in `demisto-sdk run-test-playbook`. This makes the user experience smoother for shorter test playbooks.
