- Commit and push your alterations to the remote branch.
- Initiate a pull request.
- Execute the command `sdk-changelog —init —pr_number <pr number>`.
  - It will create `<pr number>.yml` file with the following starting template:
    ```
    logs:
    - description: enter description about this PR
      type: <fix|feature|breaking|internal>
    pr_number: 'xxxx'
    ```
- Go to the generated YAML file:
  - Add a description for the changes made in the PR
  - Update the type field based on the type of changes made

#### Types:

- `breaking`: A change with backward compatibility break.
- `feature`: Adding a new feature.
