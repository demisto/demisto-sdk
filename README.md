The Demisto SDK library can be used to manage your Cortex XSOAR content with ease and efficiency.
The library uses python 3.8+.

## Usage

### Installation

1. **Install** - `pip3 install demisto-sdk`
2. **Upgrade** - `pip3 install --upgrade demisto-sdk`
3. **Connect demisto-sdk with Cortex XSOAR server** - In order that demisto-sdk and Cortex XSOAR server communicate, perfrom the following steps:

   1. Get an API key for Cortex XSOAR/XSIAM-server - `Settings` -> `Integrations` -> `API keys` -> `Get your Key` (copy it)
   2. Add the following parameters to your environment. You can also use a [.env file](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/), the demisto-sdk will automatically load that file.:

      ```bash
      export DEMISTO_BASE_URL=<http or https>://<demisto-server url or ip>:<port>
      export DEMISTO_API_KEY=<API key>
      ```
      To use on Cortex XSIAM the `XSIAM_AUTH_ID` environment variable should also be set.
      ```bash
      export XSIAM_AUTH_ID=<auth id>
      ```

      for example:
      ```bash
      export DEMISTO_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
      export DEMISTO_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      ```
      As long as `XSIAM_AUTH_ID` environment variable is set, SDK commands will be configured to work with an XSIAM instance.
      In order to set Demisto SDK to work with Cortex XSOAR instance, you need to delete the XSIAM_AUTH_ID parameter from your environment.
      ```bash
      unset XSIAM_AUTH_ID
      ```

      >For more configurations, check the [demisto-py](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-py) repo (the SDK uses demisto-py to communicate with Cortex XSOAR).

   3. For the **Validate** and **Format** commands to work properly:
     - Install node.js, and make sure `@mdx-js/mdx`, `fs-extra` and `commander` are installed in node-modules folder (`npm install ...`).
     - Set the `DEMISTO_README_VALIDATION` environment variable to True.

       MDX is used to validate markdown files, and make sure they render properly on XSOAR and [xsoar.pan.dev](https://xsoar.pan.dev).

   4. Reload your terminal.

### Content path

The **demisto-sdk** is made to work with Cortex content, structured similar to the [official Cortex content repo](https://github.com/demisto/content).

Demisto-SDK commands work best when called from the content directory or any of its subfolders.
To run Demisto-SDK commands from other folders, you may set the `DEMISTO_SDK_CONTENT_PATH` environment variable.

### CLI usage

You can use the SDK in the CLI as follows:

```bash
demisto-sdk <command> <args>
```

For more information, run `demisto-sdk -h`.
For more information on a specific command execute `demisto-sdk <command> -h`.

### Version Check

`demisto-sdk` will check against the GitHub repository releases for a new version every time it runs and will issue a warning if you are not using the latest and greatest. If you wish to skip this check you can set the environment variable: `DEMISTO_SDK_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK`. For example:

```bash
export DEMISTO_SDK_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=yes
```

### Customizable command configuration

You can create your own configuration for the `demisto-sdk` commands by creating a file named `.demisto-sdk-conf` within the directory from which you run the commands.
This file will enable you to set a default value to the existing command flags that will take effect whenever the command is run.
This can be done by entering the following structure into the file:

```INI
[command_name]
flag_name=flag_default_value
```

Note: Make sure to use the flag's full name and input `_` instead of a `-` if it exists in the flag name (e.g. instead of `no-docker-checks` use `no_docker_checks`).

Here are a few examples:

- As a user, I would like to not use the `mypy` linter in my environment when using the `lint` command. In the `.demisto-sdk-conf` file I'll enter:

 ```INI
[lint]
no_mypy=true
```

- As a user, I would like to include untracked git files in my validation when running the `validate` command. In the `.demisto-sdk-conf` file I'll enter:

```INI
[validate]
include_untracked=true
```

- As a user, I would like to automatically use minor version changes when running the `update-release-notes` command. In the `.demisto-sdk-conf` file I'll enter:

```INI
[update-release-notes]
update_type=minor
```

### Autocomplete

Our CLI supports autocomplete for Linux/MacOS machines, you can turn this feature on by running one of the following:
for zsh users run in the terminal

```bash
eval "$(_DEMISTO_SDK_COMPLETE=source_zsh demisto-sdk)"
```

for regular bashrc users run in the terminal

```bash
eval "$(_DEMISTO_SDK_COMPLETE=source demisto-sdk)"
```
