## convert

**Convert layouts and classifiers from a new version to an old version and vice versa.**

##Note:
**Classifiers/Mappers conversion from 6.0.0 and above to versions 5.9.9 and below is currently not supported. Request for converting a pack for versions below 6.0.0 will result on layouts conversion only.**

In order to run the command, `DEMISTO_BASE_URL` environment variable should contain the Demisto base URL, and `DEMISTO_API_KEY` environment variable should contain a valid Demisto API Key.
To set the environment variables, run the following shell commands:
```
export DEMISTO_BASE_URL=<YOUR_DESMISTO_BASE_URL>
export DEMISTO_API_KEY=<YOUR_DEMISTO_API_KEY>
```

* **-v, --version**

    Version to convert the entities in the given input to.
