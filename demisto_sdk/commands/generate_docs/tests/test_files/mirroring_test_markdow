## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and CrowdStrike Falcon incidents (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To setup the mirroring follow these instructions:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for CrowdStrike Falcon and select your integration instance.
3. Enable Fetches incidents.
4. Optional: You can go to the Incidents fetch query parameter and select the query to fetch the incidents from CrowdStrike Falcon.
5. Optional: You can go to the Mirroring tag parameter and select the tags used to mark incident entries to be mirrored.
6. In the Mirroring Direction integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in CrowdStrike Falcon incidents (state, status, tactics, techniques, objectives, tags, hosts.hostname) will be reflected in XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in XSOAR incidents will be reflected in CrowdStrike Falcon incidents (tags, status). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in XSOAR incidents and CrowdStrike Falcon incidents will be reflected in both directions. |

7. Optional: Check the Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding incident is closed in CrowdStrike Falcon.
8. Optional: Check the Close Mirrored CrowdStrike Falcon Incident or Detection integration parameter to close the CrowdStrike Falcon incident when the corresponding Cortex XSOAR incident is closed.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in XSOAR and CrowdStrike Falcon.
