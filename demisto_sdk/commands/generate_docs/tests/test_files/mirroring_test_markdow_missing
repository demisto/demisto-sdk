## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and CrowdStrike Falcon %%incident type%% (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To setup the mirroring follow these instructions:
1. Enable Fetching incidents in your instance configuration.
2. In the Mirroring Direction integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in CrowdStrike Falcon %%incident type%%% (%%mirroring incoming fields%%) will be reflected in XSOAR incidents. |

3. Optional: You can go to the mirroring tags parameter and select the tags used to mark incident entries to be mirrored. Available tags are 'test work notes tag'.
4. Optional: Check the Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding %%incident type%% is closed in CrowdStrike Falcon.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in XSOAR and CrowdStrike Falcon.
