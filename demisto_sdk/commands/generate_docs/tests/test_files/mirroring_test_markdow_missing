## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and CrowdStrike Falcon %%incident type%% (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To setup the mirroring follow these instructions:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for CrowdStrike Falcon and select your integration instance.
3. Enable Fetches incidents.
4. Optional: You can go to the Mirroring tag parameter and select the tags used to mark incident entries to be mirrored.
5. In the Mirroring Direction integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in CrowdStrike Falcon incidents (%%mirroring incoming fields%%) will be reflected in XSOAR incidents. |

6. Optional: Check the Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding %%incident type%% is closed in CrowdStrike Falcon.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in XSOAR and CrowdStrike Falcon.
