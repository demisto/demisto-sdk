## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and CrowdStrike Falcon corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:
1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in CrowdStrike Falcon events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |

3. Optional: You can go to the mirroring tags parameter and select the tags used to mark incident entries to be mirrored. Available tags are: test work notes tag.
4. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding event is closed in CrowdStrike Falcon.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and CrowdStrike Falcon.
