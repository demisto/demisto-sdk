## Update Release Notes

### Overview

Automatically generates release notes for a given pack and updates the `pack_metadata.json` version for changed items.

This command creates a new release notes file under the ReleaseNotes directory in the given pack in the form of X_Y_Z.md where X_Y_Z is the new pack version. The command automatically bumps the `currentVersion` found in the `pack_metadata.json` file. After running this command, add the newly created release notes file to GitHub and add your notes under their respective headlines.

For a private repository and an unconfigured DEMISTO_SDK_GITHUB_TOKEN, remote files are fetched from the remote branch of the local repo.

### Options
* **-i, --input**

    The path of the content pack you wish to generate release notes for.

* **-u, --update-type**

    Optional. If no update_type is defined, the `currentVersion` will be bumped as a revision.

    The type of update being done. Available options are:
    - major
    - minor

* **-f, --force**
