## Validate

Makes sure your content repository files are in order and have valid yml file scheme.

**Notes**
In order to run the README validator:
- Node should be installed on you machine
- The modules '@mdx-js/mdx', 'fs-extra', 'commander' should be installed in node-modules folder.
    If not installed, the validator will print a warning with the relevant module that is missing.
    please install it using "npm install *missing_module_name*"
- 'DEMISTO_README_VALIDATION' environment variable should be set to True.
    To set the environment variables, run the following shell commands:
    export DEMISTO_README_VALIDATION=True

**Use Cases**
This command is used to make sure that the content repo files are valid and are able to be processed by Demisto.
This is used in our validation process both locally and in Circle CI.

**Arguments**:
* **--no-backward-comp**
Whether to check backward compatibility or not.
* **-j, --conf-json**
Validate the conf.json file.
* **-s, --id-set**
Validate the id_set.json file.
* **--prev-ver**
Previous branch or SHA1 commit to run checks against.
* **-g, --use-git**
Validate changes using git - this will check the current branch's changes against origin/master.
If the **--post-commit** flag is supplied: validation will run only on the current branch's changed files that have been committed.
If the **--post-commit** flag is not supplied: validation will run on all changed files in the current branch, both committed and not committed.
* **--post-commit**
Whether the validation should run only on the current branch's committed changed files. This applies only when the **-g** flag is supplied.
* **-p, --path**
Path of file to validate specifically.
* **-a, --validate-all**
Whether to run all validation on all files or not.
* **-i, --input**
The path of a pack or a file to validate specifically.
* **---skip-pack-release-notes**
Validation will not not be performed using the updated pack release notes format.
