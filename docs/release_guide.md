In order to release a new version of `demisto-sdk` to the public follow these steps:

### Validation before release:
1) Make sure the **CHANGELOG.md** file is in order and is updated with all the changes in the current release.
2) Create a new release branch on the sdk repo, named according to the release version, formatted as `X.X.X`, e.g. `1.0.0`
3) Make sure that sdk-nightly and sdk-master builds are both green.
   * If there were **new commits** to the sdk after the nightly tests finished, manually trigger the sdk nightly build again (this will test sdk master on content branch) \
   * If there were **no new commits** to the sdk after the nightly tests finished, you're good. 
4) Enter the content repo, make sure you're on **master** there, and run `./Utils/trigger_nightly_sdk_build.sh -ct <circle_token> -bt <release_branch_name>`,\
   wait until the nightly sdk completes (around 2-3h, mostly for validation)\
     _circle_token is a private key tied to your github user, generate one on your circle user settings page, under `Personal API Tokens`._ 
5) If there was any change in the content creation steps (**create content artifacts** or **unify** commands) - check that the new content is valid.
To do so:\
  a) Compare the content_new.zip from nightly-sdk build and nightly-content build and see if there is any major difference between them.\
  b) If needed, trigger the nightly **Content** build from the Content repository by running:\
  `./Utils/trigger_content_nightly_build.sh <circle_token> <branch_name>` and make sure to wait until the build is finished.
6) In Demisto's content-private repository create a new branch and go to the build configuration file [**config.yml**](https://github.com/demisto/content-private/blob/master/.github/workflows/config.yml) and update the SDK installation command by replacing the line: `pip3 install demisto-sdk` with this line: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk.git@release-branch-name.`
7) Open a PR for that content-private branch, and verify the build triggered is green. Note that **this PR is for SDK version check only, and it shouldn't be merged**, after build is finished successfully - you should discard this change and close the PR.
8) Create a new content branch and update the version of the SDK in Demisto's Content repository by updating the demisto-sdk version in the [**dev-requirements-py3.txt**](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/dev-requirements-py3.txt) file. Use the release branch first - replace the `demisto-sdk==version` line with this line: `git+https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk.git@release-branch-name.`
9) Open a PR for that content branch, and verify that the build triggered is green. Note that in order to trigger the build, opening the PR is required.

### Release process:
1) Click [Here](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/releases/new) (alternatively: visit the [SDK github page](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk), click on **releases**, and then **Draft a new release**.
2) Update the **Tag version** and **Release title** to `vX.X.X` .
3) In the **Describe the release** text box enter the CHANGELOG contents for this release.
4) If nightly build passes, click **Publish release**. Your release is now public.
5) Update the [**dev-requirements-py3.txt**](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/dev-requirements-py3.txt) file again, this time with the newly-released version.
6) Wait for the regular build to finish, or force merge your PR to the Content repository.
7) Announce regarding the SDK release in the content-team slack channel.
8) Update **CHANGELOG.md** file - change the `# Changelog` header to the release version in the format `# X.X.X` e.g. `# 1.0.0`, and create a new `# Changelog` header at the top of the file.

Your release was completed successfully!
