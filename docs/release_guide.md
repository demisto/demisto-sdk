# Demisto-SDK Release Guide

In order to release a new version of `demisto-sdk` to the public follow these steps:

## Validation before release

1) Make sure the **CHANGELOG.md** file is in order and is updated with all the changes in the current release.
2) cd into the SDK folder and run `poetry update`, this will update our `https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/poetry.lock` file. You may have to `brew install poetry` to get poetry. (this step will be removed once [this issue](https://github.com/demisto/etc/issues/48161) is solved).
3) Create a new release branch on the sdk repo, formatted as `X.X.X`, e.g. `1.0.0` (push the branch to the remote).
4) In the release branch, update the version of the demisto-sdk using the command `poetry version <version>` to the future version we'll be releasing.
5) Make sure that all the following passed: [`sdk-nightly`](https://code.pan.run/xsoar/content/-/pipeline_schedules), [SDK master](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk) (last post-merge build passed), [content-gold](https://code.pan.run/xsoar/content-internal-dist/-/pipeline_schedules) and [content-private](https://github.com/demisto/content-private/actions) nightly builds passed.
   * If **new SDK commits** were pushed after the nightly tests had started, manually trigger the sdk nightly build again as written in steps 4 and 5. This will test the sdk release branch on what was content's master (until you branched out in step 4).
   * If **no new SDK commits** were done after the nightly tests, skip steps 6 to 11.
6) Enter the content repo, open a new branch and update the version of the SDK in Demisto's Content repository by updating the demisto-sdk version in the [**dev-requirements-py3.txt**](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/dev-requirements-py3.txt) file. Use the release branch first - replace the `demisto-sdk==version` line with this line: `git+https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk.git@release-branch-name.`
7) Push your branch to remote, and run `./Utils/gitlab_triggers/trigger_content_nightly_build.sh -ct <GitLab_token> -b <new_content_branch_name>`.
  **Note:** if you're on `content/master`, a notification will be sent to the content-team slack channel. The destination channel can be set via argument.
  Wait until the nightly sdk completes (around 2-3h, mostly for validation)
7) Open a PR for that content branch, and verify that the build triggered is green. Note that in order to trigger the build, opening the PR is required.
8) Enter the content-internal-dist repo, open a new branch and update the demisto-sdk version in the [**.gitlab-ci.yml**](https://code.pan.run/xsoar/content-internal-dist/-/blob/master/.gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml) file. Use the release branch - replace the `pip3 install git+https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk.git@master#egg=demisto-sdk` line with this line: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk.git@release-branch-name#egg=demisto-sdk.`
9) Push your branch to remote, and run `./.gitlab/trigger_content_gold_nightly_build.sh -ct <GitLab_token> -b <new_internal_dist_branch_name>`.
  **Note:** if you're on `content-internal-dist/master`, a notification will be sent to the content-team slack channel. The destination channel can be set via argument.
  Wait until the nightly sdk completes.
  **Note:** you should discard this change and delete the branch after the build is finished successfully.
10) In Demisto's content-private repository create a new branch and go to the build configuration file [**config.yml**](https://github.com/demisto/content-private/blob/master/.github/workflows/config.yml) and update the SDK installation command by replacing `pip3 install demisto-sdk` with `pip3 install git+https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk.git@<sdk-release-branch-name>.`
11) Open a PR for that content-private branch, and verify the build triggered is green. Note that **this PR is for SDK version check only, and it shouldn't be merged**, once the build is successful, discard this change and close the PR.

**Note:** Steps 6, 7, 9, 11 can be performed at the same time (no need to wait for one to finish before starting the other).

### Release process

1) Click [Here](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/releases/new) (alternatively: visit the [SDK github page](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk), click on **releases**, and then **Draft a new release**)
2) Set **Tag** and **Release title** to be `vX.X.X`.
3) Select the SDK release branch as the **Target**.
4) In the **Describe the release** text box, paste the `CHANGELOG` contents for this release.
5) Click **Publish release**. Your release will go through a deploy build (follow it on the [CI website](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/demisto/demisto-sdk). If the build is successful, and `vX.X.X` shows in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/demisto-sdk/), your release is public! ðŸŽ‰
6) Update [**dev-requirements-py3.txt**](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/dev-requirements-py3.txt) in a new branch, using the newly-released version, e.g `demisto-sdk==x.x.x`. **NOTE**: it may take up to an hour for our internal PyPi to sync with the real PyPi.
7) Wait for the build to finish, or force merge your PR to the Content repository.
8) Update **CHANGELOG.md** file - change the `# Changelog` header to the release version in the format `# X.X.X` e.g. `# 1.0.0`, and create a new `# Changelog` header at the top of the file.
9) Announce regarding the SDK release in the **dmst-content-team** slack channel - mention the release version, paste the `CHANGELOG` contents for this release, and add a link to demisto-sdk in pypi.

Your release was completed successfully!

**Note:** Don't forget to discard any unnecessary PR or branch you opened during the release process.
